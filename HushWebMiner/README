This is backend for javascript (WebAssembly) miner.

It connects to a pool, and provides jobs to miners connected by websockets.

Create configuration file (or change settings in the beginning of server.pl):
  POOL_WORKER_NAME = <your wallet t-address>
  HTTP_HIDDEN_ADMIN_PAGE = <some secure keyword>
  LOG_LEVEL = <'info' to reduce log details>

Optionally, install perl modules AnyEvent and Protocol::WebSocket:
- in FreeBSD by ports devel/p5-AnyEvent and www/p5-Protocol-WebSocket
- in CentOS by "yum -y install perl-AnyEvent perl-Protocol-WebSocket"

Run script:
  perl server.pl

The recommended way to run it is under separate user account with limited
permissions, with only log file available to write.
